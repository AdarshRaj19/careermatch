# CareerMatch Project: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to CareerMatch! This document provides a complete overview of the project's functionality, architecture, and workflows. Its goal is to make it easy for anyone—developers, project managers, or stakeholders—to understand how the application works.

## 1. Project Overview

CareerMatch is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to connect students with their ideal internships. It serves two primary user roles: **Students** and **Administrators**.

-   **For Students**: The platform offers tools for profile creation, AI-driven career guidance, internship searching, and application management.
-   **For Administrators**: It provides a powerful dashboard to manage platform data (students, courses, internships), run a fair and transparent allocation process, and monitor system health and equity.

The core of the platform is its integration with the **Google Gemini API**, which powers features from resume analysis to predictive simulations, making the process smarter and more personalized.

## 2. Technology Stack

The application is a modern full-stack web app built with:

-   **Frontend**:
    -   **Framework**: React
    -   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
    -   **Routing**: React Router
    -   **State Management**: React Context API (`AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`, `ToastContext`)

-   **Backend**:
    -   **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
    -   **Database**: SQLite
    -   **Query Builder**: Knex.js (manages migrations, seeds, and queries)
    -   **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, Passport.js for Google OAuth 2.0.

-   **AI Integration**:
    -   **API**: Google Gemini API for all intelligent features.

#### B. Finding & Applying for Internships
`[Internships Page]` -> `[Search/Filter Internships]` -> `[View Internship Details]` -> `[Rank Top 5 Choices on Preferences Page]` -> `[Save Preferences]` -> `[Wait for Allocation]` -> `[View Allocation Result]` -> `[Accept/Decline Offer]`

#### C. AI-Powered Career Guidance
1.  **Career Discovery (Quiz)**:
    `[AI Advisor Page]` -> `[Take Career Quiz]` -> `[AI Analyzes Answers]` -> `[View Recommended Career Paths & Courses]`

2.  **Skill Gap Analysis**:
    `[AI Advisor Page]` -> `[Enter Desired Job Title]` -> `[AI Compares Profile to Job]` -> `[View Skill Gaps & Learning Plan with Course Recommendations]`

3.  **Resume Improvement**:
    `[Profile Page]` -> `[Click "Get AI Improvement Tips"]` -> `[AI Analyzes Resume]` -> `[View Personalized Feedback]`

### Administrator Workflow

#### A. System & Data Management
`[Login]` -> `[Admin Dashboard]` -> `[Manage Courses/Internships Pages]` -> `[Add, Edit, or Toggle Status]`
OR
`[Data Upload Page]` -> `[Download Template]` -> `[Fill CSV]` -> `[Upload Bulk Data]`

#### B. Running the Allocation Cycle
`[Allocation Engine Page]` -> `[Adjust Policy Weights (Skill, Preference, Fairness)]` -> `[Click "Start Allocation"]` -> `[Monitor Live Logs]` -> `[Process Completes]`

#### C. Reviewing Results & Compliance
1.  **Results**:
    `[Results Dashboard]` -> `[View List of Matched Students]` -> `[Search/Filter Results]` -> `[Download CSV Report]`

2.  **Fairness & Equity**:
    `[Fairness Report Page]` -> `[View Placement Rates by Demographics]`

3.  **Auditing**:
    `[Audit & Logs Page]` -> `[View History of All Allocation Runs]` -> `[Download Detailed Log for Any Run]`

#### D. User Management
`[Manage Students Page]` -> `[Search/Filter Students]` -> `[Click "View Details"]` -> `[Review Student's Full Profile in a Modal]`

## 4. Key Architectural Concepts

-   **Authentication Flow**:
    -   The user logs in with credentials or Google OAuth.
    -   The backend validates the user and issues a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
    -   The frontend stores this JWT in `localStorage`.
    -   For every subsequent request to a protected API route, the frontend sends the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
    -   The backend middleware verifies the JWT to confirm the user's identity and role (`student` or `admin`).

-   **Database Schema**:
    -   The database structure is defined in `backend/migrations/`.
    -   **`users`**: Stores login info (email, password hash, role). The central table.
    -   **`student_profiles`**: Contains all detailed information about a student. Linked one-to-one with `users`.
    -   **`internships` & `courses`**: Catalogs of available internships and courses.
    -   **`student_preferences`**: Stores the ranked list of internships for each student.
    -   **`allocations`**: The output of the allocation engine. Links a student to an internship.
    -   **`audit_logs`**, **`notifications`**, etc.: Supporting tables for professional features.

-   **AI (Gemini) Integration**:
    -   The frontend **never** calls the Gemini API directly.
    -   All AI requests are proxied through the backend (`/api/student/...` or `/api/admin/...` routes).
    -   The backend constructs a detailed, specific **prompt** for the AI, often enriching it with data from the database (like a student's skills or a list of available courses).
    -   This ensures API keys are secure and allows for more complex, context-aware AI interactions.

-   **Frontend State Management**:
    -   Global state is managed using React Context, avoiding the need for complex libraries like Redux.
    -   **`AuthContext`**: Manages the current user, authentication status, and login/logout functions.
    -   **`ThemeContext`**: Handles light/dark/system theme switching.
    -   **`ToastContext`**: Provides a global, non-blocking notification system for user feedback.

## 5. How to Run the Project

### Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
2.  Install all dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create your environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
4.  **Edit `.env`**: You **must** add your **Google Gemini API Key** and your **Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.
5.  Set up the database (creates tables and the default admin user): `npm run db:setup`
6.  Start the server: `npm run dev` (It will run on `http://localhost:3001`)

### Frontend
The frontend is a static React application that is automatically built and served by the development environment. Simply open the main project URL provided by the development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser after starting the backend.
